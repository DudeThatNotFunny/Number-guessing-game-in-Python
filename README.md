# Number-guessing-game-in-Python
This is game where user try to guess random generated number. But the program will tell is that number higher or lower.
This game is right now in beta. It works, but there places where I will make improvments.

Here are two diffrent game types.
That in zip it is code where there can be added multiple lanugages. Right now there are only 2 diffrent languages ( latvian, english ).

And that file with name numberGuessing.py that will be in english, but will do the same thing.

If you want to run the code, you will need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
After install go to that dir[^1] and use this command in cmd: ```py numberGuessing.py```
